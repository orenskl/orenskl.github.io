**HiFiStreamer** is an audio network streaming software stack based on a Linux Just enough OS 
(JeOS) distribution. The main goal is to build an Audiophile grade streamer that can stream
HiFi or better (HiRes) sources from the network into an audio system. It is built so that
even non-tech audiophiles can use it with a simple and friendly UI. Using lean and simple
design to achieve Bit Perfect music reproduction.

I am Oren and for most of my life I have been building and designing HiFi components
(Amps, Pre-Amps, etc) as a hobby. DIY is a way of leaving and so I decided to put it
to a good use also when building Software.
