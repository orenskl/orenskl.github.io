I started this project so I could have a better understanding and control over my
music reproduction system. I mainly use streaming services due to the endless number
of available tracks and music albums. I truly believe that if its done right digital
reproduction of music and audio streaming can result in great way to listen to music.
Done right means first and far most a **Bit Perfect** digital path from the source (the 
network or storage device) to the sink (e.g. a Digital Audio Converter).

A good quality audio streamer is a must in every audiophile system that wants to enjoy
any streaming service out there, but streaming and software will not suffice. You have
to put and build the hardware and components to match. Every part of your system has to
be built and setup in the correct way - from the power wall outlet (maybe even before that)
to the speakers.

When I first started using [TIDAL](https://www.tidal.com) as a streaming service I used
a Fanless Passively cooled PC with a **Windows** operating system to run the **TIDAL** application.
Needless to say that was just a start and eventually I realized that this is not the way
to go. Using a general purpose OS for a streaming PC is not ideal for many reasons. I decided
to move to a **Linux** based OS and **(Ubuntu)** so I would be able to customize it more easily.
**TIDAL** does not support a native **Linux** application (a browser is not an option for me)
so I decided to install [Mopidy](https://mopidy.com) and the [Mopidy-Tidal](https://github.com/tehkillerbee/mopidy-tidal) extension to test drive it. It worked great and together with the [Mopidy-Iris](https://mopidy.com/ext/iris/) player UI I had a complete streaming software stack.

I lived with this setup for quite a while and than I started tweaking it and playing around,
for one thing I wanted to make sure I got **Bit Perfect** audio in the whole audio pipeline and so
on, all these tweaks and hacking to the system lead me to the conclusion I could share it with
the rest of the Audiophile community and even better build a complete **Open Source** **Linux** distribution
that will include all these changes I made - and this is how **HiFiStreamer** was born.

The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/orenskl/HiFiStreamer) and the images of the software are
available in the [Download](/downloads) page here and in the [Release](https://github.com/orenskl/HiFiStreamer/releases) page of the repository. For any comments or suggestion please use the GitHub issue tracking system.

Stay tuned and listen ...
